 A Little Back Story from early 2000's

 Being sick and tired of the crappy implimentation of the grid control of VB.net
 I developed this grid to allow easier programatic access, The current databound grid
 works better if its used in a databound way, If you want to use the grid in a manner simillar
 to the way it was used under VB6 you are out of luck. This grid will even expose doubleclick
 events directly on the cell ( Wow what a concept )
